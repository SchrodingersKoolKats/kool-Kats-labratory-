Client: Jacob Springs Farm 
--------------------------

Jacob Springs Farm represents a minority of smaller farms local to Boulder that emphasize their farming systems on efficiency, sustainability, and being organic. Their main goal is to minimize costs to compete with large scale farms that have more funds and resources. The main products they farm include grass fed proteins such as duck, lamb, goose, chicken and eggs and fruits, herbs, and vegetables. There is a difference in the techniques that Jacob Springs Farm uses. They use rotational grazing and organic feed.

Problem:
-----------------------------

Andre Houssney is the specific farmer our group will be working with. He oversees the management and functionality of the farm. He presented a problem of time management and waste of water in his current system to fill his water tanks. In the current system, he has a timer that is connected to the water pump and once he turns the timer on it pumps water to the tanks which are 550 ft up a 17 ft hill. The problem with the current system is that he is unsure of how long to put the timer on for. Many factors such as weather and rain affect how long the timer should be turned on. Also, Andre has no efficient way to check the water level in the tanks besides walking up the hill himself to check on it. The system must fit in the water tank and needs to be self sufficient. The system must be able to monitor water levels within the two tanks (7ft and 5ft tall) and be capable of shutting off the pump from a distance of 550 ft to prevent overflow. 
Design Alternatives: We are considering using a pressure sensor, an infrared sensor, a conductive sensor, or a float valve. We will connect this to an arduino which will send a signal via wifi from a Xbee Wireless Antenna. This signal will travel the 550 ft to the arduino board by the water pump that will use a Solenoid switch to turn off the pump.
