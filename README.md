Client: Jacob Springs Farm 
--------------------------

Jacob Springs Farm represents a minority of smaller farms local to Boulder that emphasize their farming systems on efficiency, sustainability, and being organic. Their main goal is to minimize costs to compete with large scale farms that have more funds and resources. The main products they farm include grass fed proteins such as duck, lamb, goose, chicken and eggs and fruits, herbs, and vegetables. There is a difference in the techniques that Jacob Springs Farm uses. They use rotational grazing and organic feed. Their whole process is based on being organic as possible removing unnecessary hormones, pesticides, and chemical fertilizer that larger farms use.

Problem:
-----------------------------

On any given day, there is a lot of activitiy and commotion on the farm ranging from beheading chickens to fixing fences to support the rotational grazing system. In the midst of all this activity, it is important to have good time management and a schedule that reduces friction and wasting time. There are many tasks for a farmer and this is the perspective we are using when handling any problems the farm presents. 

Andre Houssney is the specific farmer our group will be working with. He oversees the management and functionality of the farm. He presented a problem of time management and waste of water in his current system to fill his water tanks. In the current system, he has a timer that is connected to the water pump and once he turns the timer on it pumps water to the tanks which are 550 ft up a 17 ft hill. The problem with the current system is that he is unsure of how long to put the timer on for. Many factors such as weather and rain affect how long the timer should be turned on. Also, Andre has no efficient way to check the water level in the tanks besides walking up the hill himself to check on it. This creates problems as mentioned before concerning wasting time and this can take Andre away from more pressing issues on the farm. Not only that, Andre can end up wasting water once the tanks start to overflow. In our group's adventure out to the farm we witnessed this first hand while he was showing us the tanks. Another problem that Andre hopes to remedy soon is the placement of the tanks currently. There are three smaller tanks that have grown algae on the inside of them due to exposure of sunlight. As a result, Andre has built a new shed and has bought two new tanks. These will be placed within the shed and that is where we will be focusing our work. 

The system must fit in the water tank and needs to be self sufficient. The opening of the water tank isn't too wide, perhaps 12 inches, and our system needs to be able to maneuver that comfortably. The system must be able to monitor water levels within the two tanks (7ft and 5ft tall) and be capable of shutting off the pump from a distance of 550 ft to prevent overflow. The switch to turn the pumps off come from a 120V wall outlet which will also need to be accounted for. These are the specifications of this project.

Design Alternatives: 
--------------------------------

Our preliminary brainstorm session came up with four ideas: float valve, pressure sensor, infrared sensor, and a conductivity sensor. However, we consider the infrared sensor the most viable option. 

The reason the float valve isn't a reasonable choice is due to the fact that this mechanism is largely mechanical and would work well if the switch were close to the tank. However, the switch is 550 ft down an incline back towards the house. Also, a float valve isn't very interesting. But we value the concept of a float valve and we will attempt to use the "float" concept. 

The reason the pressure sensor was discarded is because the difficulty it brings. It is hard to calibrate and determine the depth of the tank from the water pressure. Also pressure sensors are rather expensive and since we only need to know when the tank is full not how full the tank is we decided that using a pressure sensor was not worth the price.
