Client: Jacob Springs Farm 
This is a local farm that specializes in being organic and efficient. They specialize in grass fed proteins and succulent fruits, herb and vegetables.
Problem: Client is looking for a system that can sense/measure water levels in the water tanks and notify or shut off the water source. 
The system must fit in the water tank and needs to be self sufficient. The system must be able to monitor water levels within the two tanks (7ft and 5ft tall) and be capable of shutting off the pump from a distance of 550 ft to prevent overflow. 
Design Alternatives: We are considering using a pressure sensor, an infrared sensor, a conductive sensor, or a float valve. We will connect this to an arduino which will send a signal via wifi from a Xbee Wireless Antenna. This signal will travel the 550 ft to the arduino board by the water pump that will use a Solenoid switch to turn off the pump.
